# Warmux

This repository contains a new setup of https://github.com/yeKcim/warmux and it's dependencies. I got it compiling and running under Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2015.
It should be clear that the Copyright of Warmux and of it's dependencies are not in my hand.

My intention for this repository is to get a deeper understanding of game programing.
